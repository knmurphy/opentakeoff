# Contributing to OpenTakeoff

Thanks for helping build a free takeoff tool for contractors. PRs,
issues, and ideas are all welcome.

## Where to start

- [`good first issue`](https://github.com/Kentucky-ai/opentakeoff/labels/good%20first%20issue)—small,
  fully specified, exact files named. Claim one in a comment.
- [The flagship challenge](https://github.com/Kentucky-ai/opentakeoff/issues/29)—an open
  design-and-build bake-off. Post a design comment first; multiple entries
  welcome; the best one merges with credit.

## Dev setup

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173 — drag in demo/sample-plan.pdf
```

Before opening a PR:

```bash
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit (the geometry libs are typed)
npm test           # node test runner over the One-Click geometry
npm run build      # vite build -> dist/
```

The optional AI sandbox lives in [`server/`](server/README.md) and the optional
capture layer in [`capture/`](capture/README.md)—neither is needed for canvas
work. If you touch `capture/`, run `python3 capture/capture_server.py selftest`
(stdlib only, no setup).

## Pull requests — how we work

- **One concern per PR.** A feature, a fix, or a refactor—not all three. Small
  PRs get reviewed fast; grab-bags stall.
- **Open an issue first for anything big.** Typo fixes and small bugs can go
  straight to a PR. New tools, new panels, or anything that changes the canvas
  feel should start as an issue so we agree on the shape before you build it.
- **`main` is protected.** Changes land by pull request with green CI
  (typecheck, tests, build—plus the capture selftest); force-pushes and branch
  deletion are blocked. Write commit subjects the way the history does—`feat(canvas):
  …`, `fix(oneclick): …`, `docs: …`—they become the changelog.
- **Show your work.** Canvas-visible changes want a screenshot or GIF in the PR;
  quantity-affecting changes want a measured-vs-expected check against the
  bundled sample plan (the PR template asks for both).
- **Stay vendor-neutral.** Generic, industry-typical rates and terms only—no
  manufacturer or product brand names in code, docs, or sample data.
- **Update the paper trail.** A `CHANGELOG.md` entry and a `FEATURES.md` row
  when behavior changes; `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` when the flow a user follows
  changes. Docs follow the house style below.
- **Review etiquette.** Comments are about the code, never the author; every
  conversation gets resolved before merge. Expect a review within a few days.
  Maintainers may push small fixups onto your branch to land a PR faster—say
  so in the PR if you'd rather make the changes yourself.

## Docs house style

The READMEs and the manuals follow the [Apple Style Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/applestyleguide/welcome/web).
The rules that come up:

- **Write to the reader, in the present tense, in the active voice.** "You" is
  the estimator or the agent's operator; the app is "OpenTakeoff", never "we".
- **Sentence-style capitalization in headings**, and "and" rather than "&".
  Heading text is a public anchor—renaming one means fixing every link to it
  (`node scripts/check-doc-links.mjs` catches what you miss).
- **Name the real gesture**: *click* a button, *choose* a menu item, *select* a
  shape or a checkbox, *press* a key, *enter* text, *drag* a grip. Not "hit".
- **Quote the interface verbatim.** A message, a menu item, or a button label
  is copied from the code, punctuation and all—so a reader can search for it.
- **No Latin abbreviations.** "For example" instead of "e.g.", "and so on"
  instead of "etc.", "versus" instead of "vs." Drop "via" as well—"through",
  "using", or "with" says which one you meant.
- **No filler**: "just", "simply", "please", "easy", "obviously".
- **Em dashes close up**—no spaces around them—except inside quoted interface
  text, which stays exactly as the app writes it.
- **US spelling**: color, labeled, centered, neighboring.
- **Say what a thing does before you say how it's built.** Refusals and limits
  are features here; state them plainly rather than burying them.


## Tuning the 3D view

The 3D look is deliberately a handful of constants, each trading one thing.
Tune them deliberately; they are the whole style:

|Constant|Where|Default|What it trades|
|---|---|---|---|
|`PASTEL_LERP`|`View3D.jsx`|0.35|Higher pushes fills further toward white under **Pastel**. Legend swatches always keep the raw condition colors, so raising it widens the gap between legend and scene.|
|`ROLL_BAND_ALPHA`|`scene3d.js`|0.25|Opacity of the alternating lane bands. Higher = lanes read instantly but fight the plan underlay; lower = subtler than the seams that justify them.|
|`ROLL_SEAM_HALF_FT`|`scene3d.js`|1/12 ft|Seam ink half-width (1″ total). Follows `FLUSH_HALF_FT`; wider starts to look like a real joint, not ink.|
|`GRID_MARGIN_FT`|`scene3d.js`|10|Padding around content bounds for the ground grid. Smaller grids clip under the model's shadow-side; larger wastes frame.|

All four ship in every screenshot under `docs/images/3d/` — retune, regenerate
the fixture screenshots, and compare against the docs to see if the look drifted.
Every 3D screenshot is reproducible: load `web/test/fixtures/3d-view-test.otk`
(a project covering every 3D-relevant case — nominal vs. true slab thickness,
derived base, transitions, wall ribbons, count posts with a per-shape override,
a deduct, and two roll-goods rooms), regenerate it with
`cd web && node test/fixtures/make-3d-test-project.mjs`.

## Architecture in one minute

- **`web/src/pages/TakeoffCanvas.jsx`**—the canvas: pdf.js render, pan/zoom
  (written straight to the DOM transform), drawing tools, conditions. Stays JSX.
- **`web/src/lib/oneclick.ts`**—pure One-Click flood-fill geometry (typed,
  node-tested). No DOM, no pdf.js import.
- **`web/src/lib/sheets.ts`**—scale table, scale-note detection, sheet-number
  extraction.
- **`web/src/lib/store.js`**—the storage seam (IndexedDB + localStorage). The
  canvas only ever talks to `store`, so a backend can be added by implementing
  the same four methods.
- **`web/src/lib/totals.js`** + **`components/ReportPanel.jsx`**—role-aware
  totaling, the Report, and CSV/JSON export.
- **`web/src/lib/contribute.js`**—the opt-in "contribute to the open flooring
  model" payload builder (derived data only).
- **`capture/capture_server.py`**—the optional local capture server: banks
  Contribute payloads as (geometry → label) training rows in a corpus you own.

## Scope

In scope: the takeoff canvas, measuring, One-Click, conditions, reports/export,
and the bring-your-own-model AI socket. Out of scope: estimating/pricing/bidding
engines—OpenTakeoff is a takeoff tool, not an ERP.

## Ground rules

- Don't break the canvas feel: pan/zoom and One-Click are the heart of the tool.
- Keep the geometry libs pure and typed; add a test when you touch them.
- Never commit real plan PDFs or any private/customer data.
