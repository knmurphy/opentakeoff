Every trace carries the engine's own account of itself: confidence (0..1, with confidence_factors naming what deducted) — a review PRIORITIZER, never a verification. 1.0 means every signal ran clean, not that the trace is right; a LOW confidence is a view_sheet {overlay: true} audit prompt, not a fact to bid from — put eyes on the flagged edge before the total means anything. SCANNED sheets work too (#154): where vectors can't bound the room (an image-only scan, or a scan wrapper whose only linework is the title block), the flood falls back automatically to the sheet's rendered pixels — same engine the canvas uses — and the reply plus the committed shape's origin carry raster_traced: true so a pixel-bounded ring is never mistaken for a vector-snapped one. Vector always wins where it works; a raster ring's corners are unsnapped, so audit it with view_sheet {overlay: true} before trusting the total.

An OCR'd scan (text layer, no vector linework) floods the rendered pixels instead (#154), disclosed per room and on origin as raster_traced. A seed is only reported as a room once it survives three gates, and everything skipped is counted and reasoned in \`withheld\` — never dropped silently, because a room the tool tells you it skipped is a question you can ask, while one it hides is a hole in a bid. The gates: a flood that leaked or landed in dense linework never becomes a region; two labels flooding the SAME region commit once (the extra labels ride on \`merged_labels\` — double-counting an area is the worst failure an estimating tool has); and a flood that is enclosed and clean but smaller than min_area_sf is a room-number bubble, a door swing, or a wall cavity rather than a room. Every room floods through the SAME sealed engine a single one_click runs (RFC #60 — feet-true gap sealing, door-swing wedges, the minimum-passage rule), so a batch detection and a click at the same seed measure the same square footage; each room carries the engine's account of its own trace (confidence + confidence_factors, gap_sealed_px, door_wedges, min_pass_px/min_pass_delta), and the same account rides origin on everything committed. Confidence is a review prioritizer, never a verification — a low-confidence room is a view_sheet {overlay: true} audit prompt, not a fact to bid from. With the sheet's scale set, returns area_sf/perimeter_lf per room.

TO COMMIT, choose the honest source of the finish tag: assign_from_schedule: true routes every room through its OWN room-finish schedule row and commits each under the FLOOR finish that row states — when a schedule exists in the set, THIS is the default move, because one agent-chosen tag across N rooms flattens real finish variety into a wrong bid; condition commits every room under that one stated tag (only right when the rooms genuinely share it; role "deduct" makes them subtract). Without a scale, returns px-only quantities per room and commits nothing — the plausibility floor needs real units, so it only applies once a scale is set.

Score ≥ 0.92 is a match; the 0.75–0.92 band comes back in \`withheld\` with a reason — a near-match is a question you answer by LOOKING (view_sheet at its \`at\`), never a silent commit and never a silent drop. The seed's own location is reported in \`seed\` and never double-committed. Work is capped and the cap is disclosed: a reply with candidates.dropped > 0 says exactly that some placements were never scored — tighten the seed rect around more distinctive geometry rather than trusting a truncated count. Marquee discipline: the rect must hug ONE instance — only segments FULLY inside it define the symbol, so a loose rect that swallows wall linework fingerprints the wall, not the symbol. scope "set" sweeps the WHOLE working set, counting on PLAN-role sheets only (the sheet graph decides): a symbol drawn in a detail, legend, or schedule is a reference drawing and never counts itself — which is also how you seed from one: marquee the assembly on the detail sheet and its plan-sheet occurrences are counted while the detail stays excluded (the exclusion disclosed in \`skipped\`, per-sheet results with per-sheet caps and wall-clock in \`sheets\`).

Seeding from a detail/legend/schedule sheet REFUSES outright until both scales are set — that is the case where an unstated ratio silently finds nothing. commit: true (requires condition) commits every match center as an EA count marker through the same path as place_count — the whole sweep (set-wide included) is ONE undo step, each marker carries origin.method "symbol_sweep" with its score, transform, and seed source, and withheld placements are NEVER committed.

A trace fills to the wall linework, so two rooms across a partition are separated by four to eight inches of nothing — testing for a shared edge finds zero transitions on a real planset. What is there is proximity, in two flavours that mean completely different things:\n\n• BUTT JOINT — the two rings run together inside ONE open space (a lobby that changes from carpet to tile with no wall between). The transition IS that run, and it commits as a linear shape under your tag, origin.derived naming both parent shapes and the measured gap.\n\n• WALL-SEPARATED — the rings run parallel across a partition. The rooms are adjacent, but the transition is NOT the shared wall: it is a threshold, in the doorway, and NOTHING in the trace record says where the doorway is (the flood engine seals openings and reports how MUCH boundary it synthesised, never where). Committing 34 LF of threshold because two rooms share 34 LF of wall would be a wrong bid with a machine's confidence behind it. These come back in \`withheld\` — measured, with their length, their gap in inches, and an \`at\` point — as questions you answer by LOOKING (view_sheet at \`at\`, then measure_line or place_count the threshold yourself).

Never audit a trace or read a dimension off a full-sheet render. region is in image px — the same space as every other tool — so a feature at pixel (ix, iy) of the returned image sits at x = region_x0 + ix × (region_x1 − region_x0) / img_w (same for y), and those coordinates go straight into one_click, measure_polygon, or read_sheet_text. overlay:true burns the session's committed shapes into the render (human-affirmed ink solid red, unreviewed machine shapes dashed blue) — render again after committing to verify your geometry landed where you intended, and sanity-check what you see: a fixture-sized ring where a room should be means the seed landed inside a stall or casework; an outsized ring means the flood escaped through an opening. To MEASURE rather than guess, pass grid: a calibrated measuring grid is burned in — thin lines every 1 ft, heavy blue every 5 ft, foot labels along the crop edges, feet counted from the crop's top-left corner. Count grid cells between walls exactly like an estimator scaling a plan; never derive a dimension by eye when the grid can give it to you. grid "auto" uses the sheet's set scale; before set_scale, pass the drawing scale read off the title block as inches-per-foot — "1/4" for a 1/4" = 1'-0" plan, "3/16", "0.25". Rendering needs the optional native canvas (@napi-rs/canvas); where it isn't installed this tool errors cleanly and every other tool still works. ${COORDS}`,

A dimension states a REAL length, so it is the one annotation the scale gate applies to: on an unscaled sheet it refuses exactly like the measure tools (set_scale first) rather than dressing a px figure up as feet. It still touches no quantity — a dimension is a note about a distance, not a takeoff line item.\n\nPass condition to attach the note to a finish tag, which is what makes it part of that SCOPE rather than a floating remark: it then wears the condition's colour on the canvas and in the marked-set PDF, and travels with it into the report. The tag is minted on first touch like one_click/measure_polygon, so you can annotate CPT-1 before anything is traced for it. Omit condition for a note about the sheet itself. \n\nNo review gate: the pencil-not-ink rule exists to stop an agent inventing geometry, and a cloud reading "verify substrate" is not geometry.
