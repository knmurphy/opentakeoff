  /** Batch room detection: read every room-number label off the sheet's text
   *  layer, seed the same sealed One-Click flood at each, and trace/commit
   *  exactly like oneClick — just N of them from one call instead of N
   *  reasoning-heavy round-trips. Same contract as oneClick: no scale → a
   *  px-only preview per room; no condition → nothing commits (a review
   *  pass, not a proposal-acceptance gate — this server has none).
   *
   *  Withholding — nothing is committed until it survives all three, and the
   *  batch NEVER silently drops work: every withheld seed is counted and
   *  reasoned in `withheld`, because a room the tool knows it skipped is a
   *  question the caller can ask, while a room it skipped silently is a hole
   *  in a bid.
   *    1. degenerate — traced to fewer than 3 vertices.
   *    2. duplicate — two labels flooding one region (a room tagged twice, or
   *       a legend number landing in the same space) trace to an identical
   *       ring. Committing both double-counts the area with no signal, which
   *       is the worst failure mode an estimating tool has. One region commits
   *       once; the collapsed labels ride along on `merged_labels`.
   *    3. bubble — plans draw room numbers inside little boxes, and a seed at
   *       the label floods the label's own BUBBLE: fully enclosed, traces
   *       clean at label size, and is not a room (found live: 25 of 26). Each
   *       label runs a SEED LADDER (anchor first, then label-height offsets)
   *       and bubble rings are rejected scale-free (ring bbox ≈ label bbox) —
   *       so the guard holds even before any scale is set. A label whose
   *       every clean flood was its bubble counts here.
   *    4. implausible — enclosed, clean, non-bubble, and still smaller than
   *       `minAreaSf` (default 5 SF — smaller than any real finished space; a
   *       broom closet is ~10 SF): a door swing or wall cavity. Only applied
