// The shared-boundary geometry behind derive_transitions (#202).

// The whole tool turns on one distinction, so that is what this pins: two rings
// that TOUCH are a butt joint and become a transition; two rings a wall apart
// are adjacent rooms whose transition is a threshold in a doorway nobody can
// see from the trace record, and must not become one. Getting it wrong in
// either direction ships a wrong number —
//   butt read as wall  → the transition is silently missing from the bid
//   wall read as butt  → 34 LF of threshold appears where a wall is
