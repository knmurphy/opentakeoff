# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenTakeoff. Dates are release/merge dates on `main`.

## 2026-07-01

### Added
- **45°/90° angle lock (polar tracking).** While tracing Area / Linear / Surface / Deduct (and the calibration line), the segment locks to the 45° family (0°, 45°, 90°, 135° across the sheet) whenever the cursor comes within ~4° of an axis — and **the click commits the exactly-on-axis point**, so walls come out dead square. Hold **⇧** to force the lock at any cursor angle. New **45°** toolbar toggle (on by default) next to Snap; endpoint Snap takes priority over the angle lock.
- **The crosshair is the cursor.** The OS pointer hides in draw modes; full-page **luminous cobalt aim hairlines** (1.5px core, fine white edge, soft bloom) meet at the house **star mark**, and in-progress work draws in the instrument's own cobalt (committed shapes keep their condition color). Lock feedback is quiet: the star swells and glows, the hairlines deepen, the **solid** (dash-free) preview line thickens, and a chip by the cursor reads the locked angle plus the live segment length — or `snap` when an endpoint snap wins. Design intentionally avoids viewer-style chrome: three heavier drafts (frosted reticle, magnifying loupe, glass pickets) were cut the same night in favor of this instrument feel.

### Docs
- New `CHANGELOG.md`, `AGENTS.md` (map of the repo for coding agents), `FEATURES.md` (capability → code), `web/public/llms.txt`, and GitHub issue/PR templates.
- User guide: new "Angle lock (45°/90°)" section + ⇧ shortcut row.

## 2026-06-28
- **Crisp detail-view canvas** — past ~1.15× zoom the visible region re-renders straight from the PDF vectors at the current zoom (Bluebeam/AutoCAD-style), so deep zoom never pixelates.

## 2026-06-23
- **Bundled sample plan** — a real (public, architect-sealed) medical-center floor finish plan with one-click **Load sample plan**; social card + README hero.

## 2026-06-19 → 06-22
- **WD-1 hardwood condition + assemblies** — trowel-aware adhesive, sealer/poly finish assemblies with real coverage rates (vendor-neutral).
- **Takeoffs panel** — edit assemblies and delete conditions inline.
- README rewrite, user guide + screenshots, one-click Netlify deploy button, SEO/OG pass.

## 2026-06-18
- **Relicensed MIT → Apache-2.0** (PRs #1–#2).
- **Supporting materials (assemblies) per condition** — coverage rate + basis → rounded order quantities; full condition edit/delete.
- **Ingest** — PDFs, images, and `.zip` plan sets through one in-browser path.

## 2026-06-15
- **Initial release** — open-source PDF takeoff canvas for flooring: One-Click Area, manual measure kit, per-sheet scale (auto-detect + calibrate), conditions with CAD hatches, waste %, reports with SF/SY/LF/EA and CSV/JSON export, client-only storage.
