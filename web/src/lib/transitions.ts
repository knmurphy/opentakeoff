// Where two finishes meet — the shared-boundary geometry behind derive_transitions.
//
// The most mechanical derivation left on a Division 9 takeoff is the transition:
// carpet meets tile, and somebody draws a line there by hand, every time, on
// every job. It is derivable — but not the way it first looks.
//
// THE CATCH, stated up front: flood-traced rooms DO NOT SHARE EDGES. A trace
// fills to the wall linework, so two rooms on opposite sides of a partition are
// separated by the wall's thickness — four to eight inches of nothing. Testing
// for a shared edge finds exactly zero transitions on a real planset. What is
// actually there is PROXIMITY, and proximity comes in two flavours that mean
// completely different things to an estimator:
//
//   butt joint      the two rings run together inside ONE open space — a lobby
//                   that changes from carpet to tile with no wall between them.
//                   The transition IS that run. Derivable, and committed.
//
//   wall-separated  the two rings run parallel across a partition. The rooms
//                   are adjacent; the transition is NOT the whole shared wall.
//                   It is a threshold, in the doorway, and NOTHING in the trace
//                   record says where the doorway is — the flood engine seals
//                   openings and reports only how MUCH boundary it synthesised
//                   (sealedPx), never where. Committing 34 LF of threshold
//                   because two rooms share 34 LF of wall would be a wrong bid
//                   with a machine's confidence behind it.
//
// So this module measures both and refuses to conflate them. The wall-separated
// runs come back as questions — with their length, their gap, and a point to
// look at — for the estimator to answer with the drawing in front of them. The
// same doctrine symbol_sweep's 0.75–0.92 band follows: a near-match is a
// question you answer by LOOKING, never a silent commit and never a silent drop.
//
// Pure geometry, no engine imports beyond distToSeg — so it tests directly, and
// both callers mount the same computation: the MCP verb derive_transitions
// (#202, agent-side) and the canvas's ⟂ Transitions button (estimator-side).
// (geometry.js's distToSeg returns distance only; a run needs the closest POINT
// too — see the perpendicularity rule below — so the projection is done here.)
