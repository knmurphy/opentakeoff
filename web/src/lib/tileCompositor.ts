// Tile-pyramid compositor glue (#86) — the DOM/Worker orchestration layer.
// Pure tile math lives in tiles.ts (tested); the worker pool lives in
// tilePool.ts. This file is the untested glue, matching the repo's existing
// split (canvasUtil.js/panelGeometry.js are pure+tested, the render effects
// in TakeoffCanvas.jsx that drive real canvases are not) — see the #86
// research note on why DOM+pdf.js orchestration stays outside node:test.
//
// Two layers per panel, mirroring the OLD base-raster + detail-overlay split
// so pan/zoom never blanks:
//   BASE  — painted ONCE per sheet, in two phases: an instant coarse
//           placeholder (level 0, a handful of tiles), then upgraded to a
//           bounded ~28MP-equivalent tiled composite (BASE_TARGET_AREA,
//           matching the OLD codebase's MAX_PANEL_AREA raster budget) once
//           those tiles land. Never re-rendered on pan/zoom after that.
//           This second phase is NOT an optimization — it's a correctness
//           fix. The detail layer deliberately doesn't repaint mid-gesture
//           (see its comment), which means the base layer is what a fast
//           pan actually shows most of the time. Shipping this at level-0
//           quality (an instant-placeholder density, maybe 1-1.5K px for
//           the WHOLE sheet) reads as "blurry and laggy" during exactly the
//           panning-across-a-big-sheet motion an estimator does constantly —
//           confirmed live, not a hypothesis. The old per-sheet raster was
//           sharp on its own up to 28MP; the base layer has to clear that
//           same bar, or #86 is a real quality regression for that gesture
//           even though the DETAIL layer is sharper than the old code ever
//           was once it engages.
//   DETAIL — repositioned/resized to [visible region + margin] on settle,
//           like the old detail view, but active at every zoom level (no
//           DETAIL_ENGAGE gate) and sourced from the tile cache instead of a
//           fresh pdf.js render. One per PANEL (not one shared global,
//           unlike the old single detailCanvasRef) — every panel in a group
//           gets independent sharpness, closing the RFC's noted group-mode gap.
//
// paintDetail double-buffers and swaps ATOMICALLY (compose off-DOM, one
// drawImage onto the visible canvas once the crop is READY — never on a
// timer, see its comment) — this is the OLD codebase's own "never a partial paint"
// rule (see its double-buffer comment history), which the first version of
// this file dropped in favor of drawing each tile the moment it landed.
// That reads, live, as tiles visibly sweeping across the sheet in whatever
// order the worker pool happens to finish them — confirmed as a real UX
// complaint, not a perf one: the fix is compositing off-screen and revealing
// once, not rendering fewer/faster tiles (see tilePool.ts for the actual
// speed fix — real N-way parallelism instead of one worker doing everything).
//
// Dark mode: tiles are cached per-mode (key suffixed :0/:1) and rendered
// inverted BY THE WORKER before transfer, not re-inverted on the main thread
// — inversion moves into the tile pipeline exactly as the RFC asks. This
// trades a possible cache doubling (only if a user actively toggles dark
// mode while looking at the same tiles) for zero main-thread pixel work.
