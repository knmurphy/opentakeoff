// Real polygon boolean subtraction for the Eraser/deduct tool — #137.
//
// Before this, a cutout committed as a second, independent shape
// (measure_role: "deduct") sitting on top of its condition's polygon; totals
// did plain arithmetic (sum floor_area, subtract deduct's area_sf), and the
// canvas painted a red hatch decal over the condition instead of an actual
// hole. No multi-ring polygon ever existed anywhere in the data model, so
// perimeter/LF never shrank around the cut and a deduct that touched the
// condition's edge didn't clip correctly.
//
// This module runs the real boolean subtract (turf `difference`) between a
// parent floor_area shape's own ring and the deduct's ring, and hands back
// the result as an outer ring + hole ring(s) — TakeoffCanvas.commitPoly
// stores that on the parent as `verts_norm_holes` (see lib/shapeCommands.js's
// `cutout` command) instead of minting a second overlapping shape.
//
// Coordinate convention: pixel-space in, pixel-space out — the SAME
// panel-relative px used everywhere else in this file (closedMetrics,
// commitPoly). Turf's boolean ops (difference/booleanContains/booleanOverlap)
// are purely topological — ray-casting and winding, not spherical trig — so
// running them on plain image px instead of lon/lat is safe. Only turf's
// MEASUREMENT functions (area/length/distance/bearing) assume a sphere; this
// module never calls those. Area/perimeter come from closedMetrics via
// polyWithHolesMetrics, exactly like every other shape on this canvas.
//
// Scope (see #137 and its follow-up issue for the fuller story): this
// resolves a deduct against a SINGLE, unambiguous parent floor_area shape on
// the same sheet — including a parent that ALREADY carries reconciled
// cutout(s): the new ring subtracts against (outer + existing holes), so N
// deducts compose into N holes and the overlap between two deducts is never
// double-subtracted (set subtraction). A deduct that touches/overlaps more
// than one floor_area shape is intentionally left AMBIGUOUS here — the
// caller (TakeoffCanvas.resolveCutout) treats a null return as "fall back to
// the legacy independent-shape behavior," which stays exactly as safe as it
// was before this file existed. Feeding the real hole geometry to export
// (JobHub/DXF) is follow-up work.
