// ── WALL-LINE SEMANTICS (audit A5b; RENAMED by audit F5) ────────────────────
// This field used to read "centerline", and that was FALSE on 60% of the
// corpus's square footage. What a golden actually traces to is a DRAWN PATH
// VERTEX: production is trace-THEN-SNAP, pulling each traced corner onto the
// nearest `extractVectorGeometry(...).points` entry within SNAP_TOL_PX (7) —
// a vertex of the PDF's own paths. Whether that vertex sits on a wall's
// centreline depends entirely on how the wall was DRAWN:
//
//   • SINGLE-STROKE wall ⇒ drawn vertex IS the centreline. Both fixture
//     generators draw walls this way, which is where the old name came from:
//       – e2e/make-fixture.cjs draws OFFICE 101 as a 216×180 pt rectangle at
//         1.6 pt stroke and e2e/one-click.e2e.cjs asserts the product measures
//         120 SF through real Chromium: 216/18 × 180/18 = 120.00 exactly.
//         Interior-clear would be (216−1.6)/18 × (180−1.6)/18 = 118.05.
//       – demo/make_sample_plan.py draws `3 w` / `120 110 980 580 re` with the
//         two interior partitions as SEPARATE strokes ("610 110 m 610 690 l S"
//         and "120 400 m 1100 400 l S").
//   • DOUBLE-LINE wall ⇒ the drawn vertices are on the wall FACES and there is
//     no centreline vertex to snap to at all. demo/sample-finish-plan.pdf (the
//     va-finish-plan case: 2580 of the corpus's 4332 golden SF, 60%) is drawn
//     that way. MEASURED on that sheet, scanning perpendicular across the
//     pinned goldens' own long straight edges: the wall lines come in parallel
//     PAIRS 7.44–9.26 image px apart at ptPerFt 18 = 4.96–6.17 in of building,
//     and each golden edge sits at offset 0.00 from ONE line of its pair —
//     i.e. on a face, not between them. Consequence: two rooms across such a
//     wall do NOT share a line. patient-toilet-137a and patient-room-137 are
//     8.79 px = 5.86 in apart at their closest, where a genuine centreline
//     pair measures exactly 0.00 (ward-room ↔ ward-vestibule, whose shared
//     boundary is one 36-px line, measures 0.000 px).
//
// A third case follows from the same rule and is what the sample plan pins:
//   • NO vertex within tolerance ⇒ the corner stays where the raster contour
//     put it. That is why the sample plan's quadrants pin at 437.978 SF and
//     NOT the 438.58 SF an ideal centreline rectangle (490×290 pt) would give.
//     The sheet has exactly 8 path vertices — the shell's 4 corners plus the
//     2 partitions' 4 endpoints — and the interior partition CROSS at image
//     (1220,784) is where two separate strokes cross, so it is an endpoint of
//     neither and not a recorded vertex (nearest is 580 px away). Each
//     quadrant's cross-corner therefore stays on the raster contour ~1 px
//     inside, costing 0.602 SF (−0.137%) per room.
//

// ── snap targets for a synthetic case (audit A5b) ───────────────────────────
// Production snaps traced corners onto `extractVectorGeometry(...).points`, and
// a SyntheticCase had no such field — it carries only `segs`. Rather than
// hand-listing a point set per case (thirteen chances to be quietly wrong), the
// point set is DERIVED from `segs` under one stated rule, because `segs` is
// already authored as an op-list mirror: consecutive entries that share an
// endpoint are one moveTo/lineTo chain, and disjoint entries are separate ones.
//
// THE RULE — exactly what `extractVectorGeometry`'s `visit()` records:
//   • moveTo (a chain's first vertex)            → recorded
//   • lineTo (every straight segment's end)      → recorded
//   • a cubic bezier                             → its ENDPOINT ONLY; the
//     CURVE_STEPS−1 interior chord vertices are never recorded, so a run of
//     SEG_CURVE chords contributes one point, at the run's end
//   • closePath                                  → records nothing (the start
//     vertex was already recorded by its moveTo)
//   • `re` (rectangle) → its four corners, which is what an `sq(...)` run of
//     four joined straight segments derives to anyway
//
// The one judgement call is reading SEG_CURVE as BEZIER provenance. It is the
// right one for this corpus: SEG_CURVE without SEG_POLYARC is precisely the bit
// `extractVectorGeometry` sets while tessellating a `curveTo`, and no synthetic
// case sets SEG_POLYARC. It is also the conservative reading — a polyline arc
// (drawn lineTo-by-lineTo) would hand the snapper a target on every chord and
// make curved boundaries snap MORE accurately, so deriving them as beziers
// gives curved probes the harder, not the easier, corpus.
