# OpenTakeoff

**A free, open-source PDF takeoff canvas — built for flooring contractors.**

Open a plan, set the scale, trace your areas, and export your quantities.
One-click room detection. Runs entirely in your browser. No account, no upload, no cost.

Commercial takeoff tools start around **$1,200–$5,500/yr**, and the flooring
options (Measure Square, RFMS, …) run **$600–$2,100/yr**. There has been **no
open-source, web-based takeoff canvas** — let alone one for flooring. OpenTakeoff
is that tool, given to the trade.

It started as the takeoff module of a private flooring estimating app and was
carved out, cleaned up, and released. The measuring engine is the real thing —
including **One-Click Area**, the flood-fill room tracer the $300/mo tools charge
for — not a demo.

## Quick start

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

Drag **`demo/sample-plan.pdf`** onto the canvas. The scale auto-detects; pick a
condition, hit **One-Click Area**, and click inside a room. Open **Report** to see
the breakdown and export CSV/JSON.

Build a static site to host anywhere (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, S3):

```bash
npm run build      # -> web/dist/
```

## Features

- **Open any plan PDF** — drag-drop, multi-page, multi-sheet (up to 4 side-by-side).
- **Scale** — auto-detects the drawn scale note off the sheet, or calibrate from a
  known dimension.
- **Measure** — Area, Rectangle, Linear, Surface-Area (walls), Count, and Deduct.
- **One-Click Area** — click inside a room; the linework bounds it, the polygon
  traces itself, vertices snap to true corners.
- **Conditions** — color + CAD hatch per finish (LVP, carpet, tile, …), a
  per-condition **waste %**, and an ×N multiplier for repeated units.
- **Report** — STACK-style breakdown by finish with measured **and** waste-adjusted
  quantities; export to CSV / JSON; print.
- **Markups** — revision clouds, callouts, text notes.
- **Yours, locally** — everything persists in your browser (IndexedDB +
  localStorage). Nothing is uploaded.

## How your data is handled

The default build is **client-only**. Your PDFs and takeoffs never leave your
machine — there is no server in the loop. You can host the static build yourself
and it stays that way.

## The open flooring model

OpenTakeoff has an **opt-in** "Contribute to the open flooring model" button. The
idea: grow a shared, flooring-tuned dataset the whole trade benefits from.

- It sends **only the derived takeoff** — condition labels, shape types,
  quantities, and *normalized* room geometry.
- It **never** sends the PDF, file names, project/client names, your markups, or
  any absolute coordinates.
- It requires an explicit attestation that you have the right to share, and the
  code that builds the payload is right here in the open ([`web/src/lib/contribute.js`](web/src/lib/contribute.js)).

Contribution is off unless an endpoint is configured (`VITE_CONTRIBUTE_ENDPOINT`),
and you can self-host or disable it entirely.

## Optional AI sandbox

`server/` is an **optional** bring-your-own-model backend: a few takeoff-scoped AI
endpoints (suggest-scale, detect-rooms, classify-finish) you can wire a **local
model** (Ollama, a vision model, …) behind to experiment. It ships *empty of any
trained model* — the default adapter is a transparent heuristic. See
[`server/README.md`](server/README.md). You don't need it to use OpenTakeoff.

## Tech

React 18 + Vite, plain JSX for the canvas, **TypeScript** for the geometry libs,
[pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) for rendering, and raw HTML5 Canvas +
SVG for drawing — no paid dependencies. See [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). In short: `npm run typecheck && npm test &&
npm run build` before a PR, keep the geometry libs pure and tested, and never
commit real plans.
