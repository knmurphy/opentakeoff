# OpenTakeoff MCP server — root-level Dockerfile so registry build systems
# (Glama and friends) that build from the repository root find a working build
# without guessing a context. mcp/Dockerfile is the same build documented for
# humans; both REQUIRE the repo root as context, because mcp/ imports the
# takeoff engine from web/src/lib and esbuild bundles it in at build time.
#
#   docker build -t opentakeoff-mcp .
#   docker run --rm -i opentakeoff-mcp        # -i: MCP speaks JSON-RPC over stdio
